* Question 1:

  - If I could have any job, I would choose to be a writer. This is because I enjoy writing, reading, and being able to stay with my family when I work.
  - First, I enjoy writing. I love writing about different type of materials, like a story, a news or a principle. Whenever I write, I feel peaceful and calm. Writing is a kind of therapy of my soul. 
  - Second, I love reading. I enjoy reading books and magzines. Reading is a way that I can keep a sharp sense of feeling of life. Also reading stimulates my intelligence. Reading is also my favorite "job". I enjoy reading fiction and non-fiction books. Moreover, I love to be surrounded by books.
  - Third, as a writer, I don't have to go to a fixed place to work. If my kid needs me, I can work at home. I love my family and certainly I want to spend more time with them. If I were a writer, I would be so excited to snuggle with my kid and think about an excited idea of a new story at the same time.
  - For all the reasons I have stated, I feel that being a writer would be my dream job. I think that it is the perfect match for my skills, interests, and values.



* Question 2:

    -  An individual whom I admire is the former CFO of the company I used to work for. I admire her because of her exceptional credibility, sincerity, and passion.
    -  The main reason I admire the former CFO is that she demonstrates credibility when I worked with her. Whenever she finds some error in my budgeting files, she would patiently explain the importance of that point and how it should be correctly presented. She never make other people feel that they are stupid or less smart than her. Thus everyone can trust her and follow her directions.
    -  Another reason I admire the CFO is that she was very sincere when she talk to other people. Even though she has to talk about her expertise very often, she is also capable of talking regular topics about daily life with a friendly and somewhat humble attitude. Her sincerity was like a kind of magic to blend herself into a crowd and make everyone feel relaxed. 
    -  The last reason I admire the CFO is that she was very passionate to participate in employee activities like group dance. Though she was almost at her retiring age, she behaved like a young lady, energetic and quick. She is such a positive person that I admire her very much. 
    -  As I have stated, there are many reasons that I admire the former CFO I met in my previous workplace. Her positive characters and life attitudes are things I find very valuable in a person.

* Question 3: 

    - In my opinion, the university should spend the money on housing improvements. The reason for this is that I believe poor housing conditions cannot be ignored and should be improved as soon as possible to demonstrate the university's responsibility for its students and potential students.
    - The first reason I would spend money on housing improvements is to benefit the students. As the housing condition is poor, there is likely to be unexpected safety hazard around students. Even though nothing happened yet, it doesn't mean poor housing condition is OK. On the contrary, good housing condition will provide students and faculties with better facilities and environment.
    - Another reason I think the university should spend money on housing improvements is that poor housing conditions hurt the reputation of the university easily. Especially for the potential students, it can be determinant to make them choose other universities with better housing conditions over this one. If the univeristy doesn't improve its housing condition, it is likely to lose potential students or even current students and faculties, which will furtherly hurt its reputation and financial condition.
    - So, to conclude, it is my opinion that the money would be spend on the housing improvements. Spending money on housing improvements is the right thing to do for a university that intend to provide its students and staff with better environment and attract more potential students and staffs.


* question 4:

  - The passage states that the problem is the poisonous cane toad. The toad is threatening many of the spiecies in Australia. 
  -  According to the passage, the problem is that the cane toad is very poisonous. The cane toad can kill animals that eat it. This is making it very dangerous for many species in Australia.
  -  To fix the problem, conservationists have decided to move some animals to other islands. They think this will allow the animals to breed in safety.
  -  In conclusion, the conservationists think the best solution to the problem of the cane toad is to move the animals to a different place.
  

* Question 5:

    - The problem the employee has is that he cannot finish his work on time. In my view, the better solution is to ask for a time extension. This is because I believe that asking for a reasonable extension will ensure job better done as well as build up better relationship with the boss than simply asking his boss to reassign it to someone else.
    - First, it is important to be honest with the boss how much time you need to finish the job. If an employee cannot finish his or her work on time. It's better to tell the boss the truth than to pretend that everything is fine. Asking for a reasonable time extension will make the employee feel less pressured and make things more controllable. No matter the boss agree or not, it will not be very unexpected if the job is done after its deadline. Thus asking for extension allows the employee to better accomplish his work.
    - Second, it is important to maintain a good relationship with your boss. Sometimes everybody in the company feels the intensity of job and it will be very hard for your boss to find someone else who can take over a project from you. To ask for an extension is better than to ask the boss to reassign a project since it allows the boss to consider how to make the most of his employee or how to make sure the job is done in time. But if an employee directly ask the boss to reassign his job, he or she is kind of making an decision for the boss, which I think will possibly hurt their relationship especially when the company is experiencing understaff.
    - Utimately, I believe the better solution is to ask the boss for a time extension. This is best for both the outcome and the working environment of the company and is what a responsible employee would do.
