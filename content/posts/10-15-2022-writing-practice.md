It is the teacher's responsibility to make a student learn the material.

In my opinion, to make a student learn the subject is not the teacher's responsibility. I believe it is for the students' benefits that teachers should not be responsible for forcibly motivate them to learn. 
First of all, I believe it is not the teacher's responsibility because I think that it is very important for students to discover their own interests and motivations to learn. Interest is the best teacher. A student with the awareness of his own interest and motivation will strive to learn what he really likes on a long-term basis. In that case, the student will keep putting his effort into his favorite subjects and thus improve his understanding and accumulation of knowledge. 
Secondly, I think teachers should not try to make students learn because I believe that students have the right to decide what they like to learn as well as what they dislike. It is the students' option to choose material for themselves. If the students don't have the right to choose but have to be limited or forced to learn certain material, it is not likely that they will think that they are study for themselves. Moreover, they would probably think that they are learning for the teacher. This misunderstanding will hurt their real motivation to learn, resulting in their reluctance to positively behave in the learning.
Finally, too much responsibility will actually be harmful for teachers is the last reason for which I think teachers should no be responsible for making a student to learn the subject. The basic obligation of teachers, I believe, is to guide and to assist students learn what they want to learn. If a teacher take the responsibility to make each one of his students learn the material, he would probably have less time to focus on helping those who really have interests in his class and want to know more. 
In conclusion, by no means that I can see that a teacher should take the responsibility of making students to learn. On the contrary, I think this idea can be harmful for both students and teachers. Therefore, a teacher should not try to make students learn his material but properly guide students into his intended teaching field and let them choose by themselves.
