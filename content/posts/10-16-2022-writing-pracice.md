Colleges and universities should offer more distant learning courses to accommodate the needs of student.

I oppose the statement that universities should offer more online classes.

First of all, online courses cannot satisfy the need for social interaction of students. Getting familiar with the professor and other students in a class can work as an important determinant of the student's motivation to learn. Interactions within the class can better help students understand what has been taught in the class. During the Pandemic, many universities have shifted their courses into online versions. However, students who take online classes can hardly build a deep connection with the professor or classmates. Now universities are trying to offer more in-person classes. In-person classes allow students to  build a personal acquaintance with the professor more easily.

Secondly, online courses cannot ensure equality among students. Since distant courses are built on the base of technology, students who have more knowledge on technology will benefit more than those who are less familiar with technology. Moreover, tests conducted on the internet are more prone to cheating than those that happen in a physical room, resulting in students with better integrity suffer more. 

Finally, distance courses loosen the positive influence of professors on students, resulting in students feeling less committed to the courses. Even though a recorded piece of music sounds great, many people would prefer to enjoy it live. Similarly, students can benefit more from an in-person class than a virtual one. The original power of influence in the lectures or speeches of a professor can be damaged or loosened during the transmission process through technological devices. Students may feel less committed when taking on online courses, which will be an obstacle for them to make the most of the class.

In conclusion, even though distance courses might be necessary for students with special needs, I don't think universities should offer too many of them since there are several essential needs of students that cannot be accommodated with them.
