Material on the internet should be censored or controlled to protect the public
I agree with the statement that online material should be censored. 

In my opinion, internet material should be consored or controlled because misleading information can cause damage to the public.(topic sentence) For example, fraud criminals may set up fake websites or post deceitive information on the internet to mislead people to invest their money in illegal financial programs(statement). Once people pay their money, thinking that they have bought a treasurous financial products, the money will be quickly transferred to undetective accounts from which they will never be returned to the owners(explanation). Such cases happen and for the most time result in financial damage of households(explanation). It is crucial to censor suck kinds of fake websites and material on the internet to prevent tragedies from happening over and over.(main idea)

Another reason I believed government or industrial regulatory agencies should censor and control information online is that fake news on the internet can always get its way to previaling and cause negative consequences among society(topic). During the Pandemic, many people were affected by misinformation or disinformation about the covid virus or vaccines on the internet, resulting in irrational buying of daily supplies as well as masks, unreasonable declination to vaccines, or wrong emotions towards certain races(explanation). Censoring and blocking fake news for the public is obiviously important(main idea).

Finally, people should ask government or industrial regulatory agencies to censor the illegal exchanges of customer privacies and inappropriate marketing information deliveries on the internet(topic). Many people have expeienced being sent commercials that reveal their privacies or being hooked up to buy things they don't need, both of which are very annoying(explanation). Such material should be limited through effective censorship(main idea). 

In conclusion, I support the idea that material on the internet should be censored. Information with mal-purposes, fake news, and unproper marketing information should be eliminated or limited from the internet.
