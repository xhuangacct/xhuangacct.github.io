**Topic**
The following appeared in an announcement issued by the publisher of The Mercury, a weekly newspaper:
*Since a competing lower-priced newspaper, The Bugle, was started five years ago, The Mercury’s circulation has declined by 10,000 readers. The best way to get more people to read The Mercury is to reduce its price below that of The Bugle, at least until circulation increases to former levels. The increased circulation of The Mercury will attract more businesses to buy advertising space in the paper.*
**Conclusions**
- *Intermediate conclusion*:
    (1)"The increased circulation of The Mercury will attract more businesses to buy advertising space in the paper."
    (2)"The best way to get more people to read The Mercury is to reduce its price below that of The Bugle, at least until circulation increases to former levels."
    - The Mercury's circulation will increase if it lowers the price below that of The Bugle.
    - The Mercury will gain more advertising revenue if its circulation increases.
    
- *Final conclusion*:
    "The best way to get more people to read The Mercury is to reduce its price below that of The Bugle, at least until circulation increases to former levels."
   - Therefore, The Mercury should lower its price blew that of The Bugle.
**Evidence**
   "Since a competing lower-priced newspaper, The Bugle, was started five years ago, The Mercury’s circulation has declined by 10,000 readers."
   - The Bugle started five years ago with price lower than that of The Mercury. The Mercury's circulation has declined by 10,000 readers in the past five years.
   - This is a false cause problem. It is unassured that the emerging of The Bugle has caused the decrease of The Mercury's circulation. The circulation fall of The Mercury may be due to other reasons such as its poor management or its ineffective marketing strategy. Or perhaps a large population of people turned to read news through computers instead of newspapers in the past five years.
**Assumption**
- The decrease of The Mercury's circulation is simply caused by the existence of a cheaper newspaper, The Bugle. 
- The Bugle's circulation is higher than that of The Mercury now. Maybe The Bugle's circulation is equal to or lower than that of The Mercury, which indicates the opposite insight that lower price doesn't draw more readers, then there is apparently no point for The Mercury to turn down  its selling price. 
- The successful circulation of the Bugle is merely attributed to its relatively low price. Perhaps The Bugle invested a large sum on marketing during the past five years, which in return saw an significant increase in its readership. Or maybe The Bugle is a daily paper offering large amount of local news and updates, which contribute to its exceptional readership. 
- Businesses make decisions of advertising platform merely based on circulation data. Companies prefer to choose an advertising platform that can effectively access their targeted customers. 
  
Mentioning that the circulation of a weekly paper, The Mercury, has declined after a competing lower-priced paper, The Bugle, started, the author of the announcement concludes here that The Mercury should lower its price below that of the Bugle in order to increase its circulation to former levels and gain more advertising revenues. However, the author's argument relies on a series of unproven assumptions and is therefore unconvincing as it stands.

One such assumption is that The Bugle, which is lower-priced, has a higher circulation than The Mercury. The mere fact that the circulation of The Mercury has declined by 10,000 readers since the Bugle started hardly suffices to show that The Bugle has taken a larger proportion of market than The Mercury during the five years. For all we know, The Bugle's circulation might be equal to, or perhaps lower than, that of the Mercury, in which event the author’s recommendation would amount to especially poor advice.
Even assuming that The Bugle does have more readers than The Mercury, lowering its price below that of the Bugle might not help The Mercury attract more readers, especially if The Bugle is not a weekly paper but a daily paper that offers large amount of location news and updates, which significantly contribute to improving its readership. Besides, The Bugle might have spent a large sum on its marketing compaigns that account to its large readership. Without ruling out these and other reasons why The Bugle has a higher circulation, the author of the announcement can’t convince me that The Mercury would gain more readers simply by lowering its price.

Even if the price does give The Bugle a competitive advantage over The Mercury to attract readers, The Mercury would not necessarily improve its circulation through turning down its price to a level lower than The Bugle's price. It might be that both circulations of The Mercury and The Bugle have been declined in recent years because a large population of people no longer buy newspapers due to an economic downturn or people simply read news through other sources such as computers and smart phone, in which case lowering price might ________, or perhaps even _______, ________________________.

As for _________________, ______________ might be due to particular factors that ______________. For example, perhaps _______________
___________________. Or perhaps ______________________________, due to __________ differences between the two ____. In short, the ___
____ simply cannot justify his proposal on the basis of ___________
____________.

In sum, the argument relies on what might amount to _________________
________________________, as well as __________________________
____________________, which may or may not apply to _______. Thus, even though the ________ has provided some scant evidence to support the recommendation, on balance I find the argument unconvincing at best.







The author of this recommendation has identified a problem; that the circulation of the weekly newpaper, The Mercury, has declined over the last five years. The author claims that this decline is the direct resut of the introduction of a lower-priced paper, The Bugle, five ago. He recommends lowering the price of The Mercury so that it is less than that of The Bugle, which he elieves, will increase readership and attract more advertisers. It may be that the author has accurately identified the cause of The Mercury's decline. However, he has made assumptions and omitted key information to support his recommendation.




 At the outset, the author assumes that The Bugle's readership is greater than that of the Mercury, and that the 10,000 readers who no longer buy Th e Mercury now spend their money on The Bugle. This may be the case, however, the author has not provided circulation data or other information that would identify why readers are no longer interested in reading The Mercury or to prove that The Bugle's readership is increasing in correlation to The Mercury's decrease. Without this information, there is no way to know what has become of the lost readers of The Mercury. They may have moved from the city in a mass exodus due to housing or employment issues. They may now read their news online or rely on television news resources, and see no reason for the additional expense of a newspaper, and it could be that the circulation of both papers is on the decline. If the reason for the loss of readers is anything other than readers choosing a less expensive paper, lowering the price will decrease the company's revenues without increasing circulation.
  The author also assumes that other than price, the two newspapers are identical. If The Bugle is a daily paper, it may be that readers prefer news that is more current than the weekly paper, The Mercury, can provide.If that is the case, reducing the price of The Mercury will have no impact, as readers will continue to avoid the stale weekly news in The Mercury. It may also be the case that the two papers do not cover the same type of news. Perhaps The Bugle is staffed by experienced journalists who provide in-depth reporting of issues that are of great concern for citizens, while The Mercury focuses on human interest stories and publishing births, deaths, and anniversaries. If that is the case, those interested in learning more about the issues facing the community will not purchase The Mercury now that a hard newspaper is available.
  Finally, the author asserts a causal chain: lowering the price of the paper will increase circulation, which will then attract advertisers. He suggests that advertisers are motivated primarily by other factors, the potential for increased circulation will not result in additional advertisement sales. The author has not compared advertising rates or presentation between the two papers. Perhaps The Bugle's advertising rates are similar to those of The Mercury, but ads are presented in full color, or perhaps, The Bugle's rates are less than those of The Mercury. Or, perhaps, advertising in newspaper is universally declining and neither paper should expect to increase advertising revenues, as advertisiers turn to other media, such as radio and internet marketing.
  The publishers of The Mercury should review very carefully before taking action. The base assumptions, that The Bugle has a greater circulation than The Mercury, and that the difference is the direct result of the price difference between the two papers are not evident, and the other claims and recommendations presented fail to make the author's case for lowering the price of The Mercury.
