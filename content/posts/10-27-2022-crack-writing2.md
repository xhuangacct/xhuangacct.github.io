Sample Response

Main idea

Department stores should anticipate the growing population of middle-aged shoppers by replacing products intended for younger consumers with those that will attract middle-aged consumers.

Claims and/or Assumptions

1. Total retail expenditures of middle-aged and younger consumers are equal so that 39% of middle aged retail expenditures is greater than 25% of younger consumer expenditures.

2. The percentage of retail spending done in department stores will remain static into the future, so that consumers will continue to spend money in the next decade as they currently do.

3. There is a significant difference in the types of products of interest to middle-aged and younger consumers.

4. By replacing products that attract younger consumers with those that attract middle aged consumers now, department stores will appeal to older consumers in the next decade.

Additional information needed to analyze the argument

1. Average total amount of money spent on retail expenditures by middle-aged and younger consumers  

2. Information on spending trends currently, such as what retail venues might be experiencing a trend of increased expenditures over time

3. Information to show that retail expenditures in department stores have either remained steady or increased in the last ten year

4. Information about the types of products that appeal to middle aged and yonger consumers

Sample Essay

Based on data measuring population trends and information about the retail expenditures of people of different ages, the author proposes re-evaluating inventory of department stores to better accommodate the unique tastes of middle-aged shoppers, whom, he claims will spend more money than younger consumers in the next ten years. It may be that middle-aged shoppers will become the most active department-store spenders in the next decade, and that this recommendation is insightful of future trends. However, the author has made potentially flawed assumptions about the information he has, and, as a result, has made a recommendation based on predictions that may not be accurate.

First, the author begins by comparing the retail expenditures of middle-aged and younger consumers. To support his recommendation the author assumes that both groups of shoppers allot the same amount of money toward retail expenditures, so that 39% of middle-aged expenditures is greater than 25% of younger shoppers' expenditures. However, that may not be the case. For example, it may be that younger shoppers, who may live with their parents or with roommates, and who are attracted to trends and fads, may allot up to $1000 per month toward retail expenditures. Middle-aged shoppers, on the other hand, may have other expenses, such as home mortgages, college tiution, and health insurance, and therefore choose to allot just $100 per month to retail expenditures. In this scenario, younger shoppers would, on average, spend $250 per month in department stores, while middle-aged shoppers would spend just $39. To bolster his recommendation, the author should include data on the average dollar amount spent on retail expenditures by each age group.

Further, the author's recommendation is dependent on the idea that as the population of middle-aged people increases, the percentage of their retail expenditures spent in department stores will remain unchanged. If, as the population ages, new and more convenient forms of commerce emerge, such as more robust online shopping experiences, or if an economic downturn within the next ten years limits the disposable incomes of people in this population group, the author's claim will not hold true, as they may spend less money in department stores than people of similar age did ten years earlier.

Another point that is crucial to the author's claim is the notion that middle-aged shoppers and younger shoppers seek vastly different products, so that a department store that caters primarily to younger shoppers will have little to offer those who are middle-aged. Without information about the types of products most often purchased in department stores, this point does not hold true. For example, it could be that department stores are the primary shopping venue for those of any age seeking wardrobe staples, such as athletic shoes, underwear, or basics such as white shirts and khaki pants. If most shoppers choose department stores for these, regardless of age, the aging population may not change types of products shoppers buy in department stores.

Finally, the author recommends changing store inventory now to accommodate older shoppers that may purchase from department stores in the future. If department stores are currently profiting from selling products to younger customres, and, if the growth in old shoppers does hold true, it will not be for several years. Changing the inventory may result in decreasing expenditures from younger shoppers and result in no change in purchases from those who are middle-aged.

While the author's recommendations may hold true, the author has not provided enough data to support his opinion, and action taken based on this passage may not yield the desired results. If department stores follow this advice without further information, they may risk seeing a decline in sales currently and in years to come.
