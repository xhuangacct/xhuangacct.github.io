The author of this editorial clearly cares about the impact of industrial manufacturing on the environment, and has written an editorial suggesting a means of ensuring manufacturers are held responsible for the damage they do to the environment, which he believes will lead to a decrease in environmental impact. While the intent of the recommendation is laudable, the author has made several assumptions and omitted key information that might show it would be effective.

The crux of the author's recommendation is the notion that compelling companies to write detailed reports on the environmental damage caused by their manufacturing activities will in some way lead to a reduction in environmental damage. He further suggests that requiring the filing of these reports by threatening stiff finacial penalties will ensure that the documentation is complete and filed in a timely fashion. However, reproting environmental damage is not the same as reducing environmental damage. Nowhere in this recommendation is there any suggestion that companies will be penalized for poluting or otherwise damaging the environment. Rather, the only penalty noted is for failing to produce the report on time. So, in theory, a manufacturer could polute rivers, forests, and parklands with toxic waste year after year, and face no penalty whatsoever, as long as the pollution were recorded in a report submitted to the federal government by the established due dates. In order for this recommendation to fulfill the author's intent of reducing pollution it must include some penalty or saction related to the acutal pollytion, and not only to the timely record keeeping of the polluting activities.

This recommendation also assumes that no such reporting mechanism is currently in place, and that manufacturers are currently not held accountable for reporting their environmental impact. If that is not the case, an if comanies already file reprots on environmental damage with the federal government, this recommendation offers no change to the current procedure, and would not be likely to affect any change in the damage caused by industiral manufacturing. To support his argument  the author should include information about current reporting requirements and how his recommendation improves upon those requirements.
Another point the author has not considered is  the possibility that manufacturers may compile reports that are incomplete or inaccurate. This recommendation does not suggest that companies will face penalties for filing reports that are not 100% accurate. Companies could simply lie about the environment damage caused by their companies, and , as long as they file the reports on time, face no penalities. In order to support his goal of reducing environmental damage the author should devise some means of auditing reports ro ensure accuracu so that the information submitted is a true representation of the companies' actions.

Finally, the author believes companies will be motivated to submit the required reports by the threat of stiff penalties. He has, however, neglected to consider the cost companies will incur in producing these reports. If companies determine that the cost of recording and reporting environmental damage is greater than the fines they would face if they neglected to do so, it is likely that many would simply fail to submit the information, pay the fine, and continue on with the current business practices. To make this reporting procedure truly mandatory, the author should develop some means of compelling compliance that is certain to lead to all companies filing the reports.

 The author's intent is commendable, and most readers would agree that protecting the environment from damage caused by industrial manufacturing should be a priority; however, there is no evidence that this recommendation will fulfill that goal. The author should revisit the assumptions that drive the recommendation and consider additional information necessary to create a relevant and effective proposal.



 Assumption 1: no difference between building awareness of a champion and selling product
  3: publishing picture and name can increase sale to the same extent of building awareness.
* name recognition is increased by posting images on billboards
* awareness of products can be increased in the same way as awareness of a champion sports star
* the national publicity the marathon champion received did not affect her name recognition among the surveyed residents
* awareness of the marathon champion as a direct result of the billboards

 2: the second survey applied exactly the same sampling method and has same range.
* respondents of the first and second surveys were identical
  
 4: customer's products are already know to 5% of the residents.

 5: people in other cities are like river city as for taking information from billboards.

 6: people will buy product if they can recognize it
* name recognition of a product equates to an increase in product sales.


sample essay
In an ambitious sales campaign, Big Boards,Inc. claims that exposure via their company's billboards will raise awareness of a client's product by 30 percent within just three months, and that the raised awareness of the product will result in increased sales. The company's claim is based exclusively on the results of a name recognition study Big Boards, Inc. conducted relative to a national women's marathon champion. The claim of this sales proposal is based on several assumptions and lacks relevant data. So, while exposure via Big Boards billboards may have some effect on product sales, **there is no way to determine that outcome based on the evidence provided.**

**The main claim in this proposal relies on the notion that** *Big Board billboards were responsible for raising public awareness of a national champion marathon runner*. The author notes that when the billboards bearing the runner's image were first erected she had just been named champion. In the three months that the billboards remained posted around the city the champion **also** received national publicity for her achievement. **Although the author claims that** the billboards were the cause of the significant increase in awareness of the marathon runner's achievements, **it is just as likely that** during the three months the billboards were in place the residents saw the marathon runner on television interviews, magazine covers, and on the internet. **There is no evidence that** the billboards, specifically led to the increased awareness.

**Even if** Big Board billboards could somehow prove that their billboards were the only reson people became aware of the marahton champion, **there is no evidence to support their claim that** increased awareness will lead to increased sales. What, if anything, was sold through the increased awareness of the marathon champion's achievements? **Without evidence that** the public's awareness of who the champion was could be tied to some purchasing action, such as buying action figures, fitness wear, or other some product, **this claim cannot reasonably be made**.

**Finally, even if** readers accept that Big Board billboards raise awareness, and that the raised awareness could result increased sales, **the author would have to provide some evidence to show that** the net increase in revenue created by these sales would offset the cost of the billboards **for this to be a reasonable proposal**. That is, if raising awareness by 30% in fact led to raising sales by 30%, **the author would have to show evidence that** a 30% increase in sales would be more than the cost of the billboards. If, for example, a candy campany which had an average monthly revenue of $10,000 per month decided to advertise on several billboards throughout River City at a cost of $5,000 per month, and, as a result, saw an increase in sales of 30% or $3,000 per month, the company would experience a net loss of $2,000 per month. **Without more information, it is not clear** what companies could, potentially, benefit from this type of advertising.

**While** billboard advertising **may be** an effective means of raising product awareness, **and might even, in some cases** lead to increased sales, **this proposal does not support either claim**. **The author has made broad assumptions about** the effects of the billboards **and has not included relevant information necessary to prove his point**.4:00
