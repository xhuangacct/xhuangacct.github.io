Sample Essay

*This travel magazine ariticle clearly recommends that* **business travelers** choose Speedee Airlines because of the airline's superior on-time rates and because it has increased its number of flights and the number of destinations it serves. *The author has made several assumptions in making this argument and has neglected to include key information that would show it to be true.*

*First, the fact that* **at a time in the past**, when airlines were first required to report on-time rates, Speedee Airlines was at the top with 89% of its flights on time *is laudable*. *However, the author neglects to note how long ago this was*, the on-time rates reported by other airlines, *and if these statistics have changed in the time since* reporting was first required. *This additional information could demonstrate if this statistic is irrelevant*. *For example*, if the initial reporting requirement occurred ten years ago, and since then Speedee's on-time rate has declined to 50% while the rates of Swift Airlines and Quicklee Airlines have increased to 90% and 95% respectively, *there would be no reason to* choose Speedee airline for a route currently serviced by either of these two airlines. *In addition, if* at the time of reporting, there were multiple airlines ranked at "the top" with 89% on-time flights, *there would be no reason to believe that* Speedee Airlines was superior in efficient service.

(good transition)*If, in fact,* Speedee was the only airline ranked at the top for on-line service, *and if* it has maintained that rate, and no other airlines have surpassed this statistic, *there still is not enough information to determine* Speedee is the best choice for business travelers. Speedee may experience 100% on time rates for some destinations, such as short trips from smaller regional airports to remote vacation destinations on flights that are run several times a day, but on longer, less frequent flights to cities typically considered business centers, experience long delays and flight cancellations, making it impractical to rely on Speedee for reliable travel to these cities. The statistic alone does not demonstrate service that would appeal to business travelers, and more information is required to demonstrate on-time travel to the most desirable cities for business travelers.

The author also notes that Speedee Airlines now offers more flights to more destinations than ever before, which gives 
the reader the impression that the airline maintains a wide range of routes with frequent flights. However, there is no point of comparison. If, in the past, Speedee served two cities with two flights daily and now serves three cities, with three flights daily, it does, indeed serve more cities and offer more flights than ever before, but its routes and availability of flights remain limited. Even if Speedee has a more typical number of routes and flights, the addition of more routes and flights is not necessarily a benefit for business travelers. If, for example, Speedee flies from mutiple mid-western cities to multiple vacation destinations such as Orlando, Cancun, and the Bahamas, but offers no flights at to New York, Los Angeles, or Chicago, the additional routes and flights would be of little benefit to typical business travelers. The author must provide specific details about the routes, cities served, and number of flights daily to support this point.

The author of this article is enthusiastic about Speedee Airlines, but his enthusiasm may be misplaced. Without additional information to support his assumptions and data to support his claims, this cannot be considered a meaningful recommendation for business travelers.
