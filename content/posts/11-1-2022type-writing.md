Workers are generally interested int management issues. 

details about the questionnaires. do they have other topics within management processes. how do workers react to other isssues.

Didn't offer relative information about why workers are generally thought to be apathetic about management issues. Withou data and statistics, the comparison of workers' post attitudes and so-called new attitudes cannot be made.
Only one source is not enough to make that conclusion. There may be other questionnaires that show works doesn't feel interested in management issues.

in the survey, do they respond to typical management questions or questions that are closed related to themselves? It may be because these issues are going to affect their positions and benefits directly so they pay attention to them.
corporate restructuring and redesign of benefits programs will affect the workers' positions and benefits.


* The reader should subscrive to the common notion that workers are generally apathetic about management issues such as changes to benefits plans and corporate restructing, as evidence shows that is not the case.

assumptions:
* The idea that workers are not interested in management issues is outdated, or that they were not interested in these issues at some time in the past.

* The 1,200 workers suveyed are representative of the entire workforce of the region.

* Workers are interested in issues related to corporate restructuring and redesign of benefits programs because they care about the impact of these issues on the corporations.

* Respondents consider these issues, management issues, and not employee issues

* Respondents were not engaged in management roles.

The author of this editorial makes the claim that the "common notion" that workers are generally apathetic about management issues is false, or at least outdated," based on the results of a survey completed by 1,200 workers. While these results, that 79% of respondents are concerned with issues such as corporate restructuring and redesign of benefits programs may indicate employee interest in management issues, the author has not provided enough information to confirm that is the case.

The author of this claim has made several assumptions in developing the claim, many of which are not supported. First, he begins from the position that there is a "commom notion" that some topics typically considered management issues are of little or no interest to workers. However, there is no evidence of prior surveys or any other evidence that this "notion" has been held in the past or if it  was widely held. Therefore, there is no way to show that this survey indicates significantly more interest in these issues than existed at some time in the past.
Another assumption made by this author is that the 1,200 workers surveyed are representative of all workers. If, for example, the majority of workers surveyed are those who aspire to management positions or were, at the time of the survey, in management training programs, the responses they provided would be different from workers with no management experience or aspirations, and would, therefore produce results that are not representative of all workers. Furthermore, even if the workders who responded were not engaged in or aspiring to management roles, there is no information about the setting of the survey. It could be that workers were closely supervised while completing the surveys and felt compelled to answer in a way that appeared to be supportive of their employer, even if those answers were not reflective of their own opinions. To further bolster the author's claim, more information about the sample and context of the survey should be provided.
Even if the survey were given primarily to workers with no management aspirations, and if the context were conducive to candid answers from these workers, the issues noted, changes to the company's organization and to the benefits offered to employees, are not of interest exclusively to those in management. Workers might be interested in information about corporate restructuring, for example, because restructuring activities can lead to downsizing and layoffs of workers. Similarily, restructuring benefits programs would likely have a direct impact on workers, including health insurance, vacation, and retirement programs, all of which are topics that are of great concern to all workers, and not only to those in management. The author of this claim would better be able to support his stance if he were to survey workers on issues that clearly interested only those in management, such as executive profit sharing or long term expansion planning.


Finally, the author notes that 1,200 surveys were returned, but does not indicate how many were distributed. If for example, surveys were distributed to 12,000 workers, but only 1,200 responded, that would indicate that 90% of those who received the survey were not interested in responding, thus supporting the "common notion that workers are generally apathetic about management issues."
Overall, this is an interesting claim, but the author has not provided the details and data necessary to show it to be true.
