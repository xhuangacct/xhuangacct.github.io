**acquisition of plant asset**

* historical cost is objective
* historical cost consists of all expenditures ordinaru and necessary to acquire an asset and make it ready for its intended use
* changes in a plant asset's fair value subsequent to acquisition are generally ignored
 - companies should not anticipate gains, but should recognize gains only if/ when a plant asset is sold

**major sub-classifications**
land/building/ready for use/lease/

**cost of land**
costs typically include:
 * 1)purchase price
 * 2)closing costs(title fees, attorney's fees, recording fees, broker commissions, etc.)

  7) common costs must be allocated between the land account and the *Building* account
  -typically allocated on the basis of relative fair value (market value) or tax assessed value
**Environmental liabilities**
The acquisition of certain types of tangible, long-lived assets results in the purchaser's assumption of future mandatory liabilities associated with the end of the asset's useful life
**Asset Retirement Obligations(AROs)**
typically consists of costs associated with
- Dismantling
- Asset Retirement Obligations are initially recorded at fair value
  - generally the discounted present value of those estimated future cash outflows
- The effective-interest method is used to amortize the ARO and recognize periodic accretion expense
  - accretion expense is recognized as an operating expense  
-
