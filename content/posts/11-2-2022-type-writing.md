The president of a shampoo company declines a research finding that HR2 in their shampoo can contribute to hair loss and thinks they don't need to consider replacing the HR2 in their shampoo with a more expensive althernative.
* The company should continue to use HR2 in their shampoo because there have been no customer compaints and other shampoo companies also use the compound.


because the number of subjects to the study is limited to 500, the finding is not convincable.
Since they didn't received any customer complaints last year, their shampoo with HR2 inside is not causing hair loss.
Many competitors use more HR2 per bottle of shampoo than they do, so it is safe to use HR2 in their shampoo, too.
the size of bottle are all the same among all shampoo companies.

Assumptions(weird)
* The lack of complaints indicates customers are not experiencing hair loss.
* The term "prolonged use" refers to a time period of one year or less.
* The size of bottles of shampoo sold by competitors is the same as that of this company
* There are no chemical compounds that, if combined with HR2, mitigate the risk of hair loss.
Add information
* what length of time is indicated by "prolonged use".
* The results of the study that indicated a risk of hair loss
* The size of bottles of shampoo marketed by competitors that use more HR2
* the size of this company's bottles of shampoo
* The method by which customer complaints are received and tabulated.

Sample Essay
In this internal memorandum the CEO of this shampoo company advises that the company will continue to use the chemical HR2 in its shampoos, despite some recent information that it may lead to hair loss. He asserts his position based on the limits of the study that indicated the hair loss problem, by citing the lack of customer complaints, and by noting that some of the company's competitors actually use more HR2 in their shampoos. The CEO has made several assumptions and omitted key information, and, therefore, his recommendation is not sound.
The CEO feels his position is buoyed by the limits of the study, which included only 500 participants. While it may be the case that the survey population was not generally representative of the average user of the company's shampoo, more information is required in order to make this point. The CEO should include demographic information about the average user of the shampoo, and compare that information to the study sample. If, for example, the shampoo is most popular with teenage boys living in the northest, and the study was conducted exclusively with teenage boys in the northest, then the results would be directly relevant to the CEO's product and would demonstrate a need for more study before dismissing them. The CEO must show that the limits of the survey mean that it is not applicable to his customer base.
In addition, there is the question of what is meant by "prolonged use." The CEO does not include information about the duration of the study cited. He also notes that the company has not received any compalints about the shampoo in the last year, or twelve months. If the hair-loss caused by HR2 tends to occur after 18 months, it could be that the CEO's current confidence is misplaced, and that, in six months, the company will buried with complaints from balding customers. Unless the CEO provides information about the duration of the study and the amount of time required to show the noted hair loss, the lack of complaints in the past year is irrelevant.
Further, the CEO does not explain the process by which customers may submit complaints. Perhaps customers who wish to leave feedback are presented with a standardized form on which to rate their satisfaction and that form does not provide opportunity for individual feedback, specifically that the customer is suffering hair loss. It may also be that customer complaints are routed through several different departments and handled automatically with coupons for free products or other incentives, and there is no means by which the CEO is made aware of complaints.
The CEO further argues that some of their competitors use more HR2 per bottle of shampoo than his company, offering that fact as more evidence that there is no danger for customers and that they should continue to use HR2. However, the CEO does not offer information about the relative sizes of the bottles of shampoo sold by either company. For example, if the CEO's company sells six ounce bottles of shampoo which contains 4 ounces of HR2 and their competitors typically sell 36 ounce bottles of shampoo containing 4.5 ounces of HR2, then although the competitors use more of the chemical, the concentration is much lower and customers are exposed to less of the chemical, making it less likely that they will experience the adverse effects with prolonged use.
The CEO is understandably concerned with the cost of replacing HR2 with a more expensive additive. However, he has not shown that the chemical is safe for customer use and not provided the evidence necessary to prove that customers using their shampoo will not experience adverse effects.
