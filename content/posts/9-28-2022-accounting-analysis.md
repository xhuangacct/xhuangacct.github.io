    : According to Joe Tenebruso (2021), Amazon’s stock price jumped in October 2021 after its retail sales unexpectedly climbed in September 2021. At that point, analysts predicted that Amazon would boost its profits to as much as 15% (Tenebruso, 2021). PayPal Holdings announced in November 2021 that Venmo users can start using the Venmo app to purchase Amazon products starting next year (Bowman, 2021), further boosting the stock price. These are the most important reasons that Amazon’s stock price reached its peak in the past year.
Amazon stock plunged in the second quarter of 2022 since Amazon reported a net loss of $3.8 billion for the first quarter of 2022 (Iyengar, 2022). Due to the pandemic, war in Ukraine, and ongoing inflation, Amazon was under supply chain pressures and had higher costs than the previous year. Stock prices had dropped continuously during April and May 2022, contributing most to its lowest price in the past year.
14. Write about any recent activity/event affecting the company in your own words. Your write up must be at least 200 words. (6 points)
    : On July 12 and 13,  2022, Amazon was estimated to have generated 11.9 billion dollars in revenue from its Prime Day deal event (Berthiaume, 2022), which was an 8.5% increase over last year. According to Amazon (“Prime Day 2022”), its Prime member customers bought more than 300 million items worldwide during the two days. Sales revenue on Prime Day reached its peak in Amazon's history in 2022 and was supposed to signal a pick-up trend of sales revenue on regular days as well. Amazon’s stock price went up after the first day of Prime Day. It rose more than 20% since July 12 to its current level by the end of July. This is a good sign for Amazon’s stockholders. The impact of Amazon's Prime Day sales on total sales growth will be seen in the third quarter of 2022. Investors will be optimistic about Amazon's profitability if the total growth exceeds its expected value, and if that is the case, the stock price is likely to rise in October. However, before the financial report of the third quarter is released, it’s hard to say which direction the stock price will go. It is unlikely that Prime Day 2022's record-breaking sales will boost sales on regular days, nor will it influence the stock price long term.
15. Compute any 8 financial statement ratios. Comment briefly on your findings regarding each ratio. (24 points)
|Ratios|Mar 2022|Comment|
|----|----|---|
|1) Current ratio|0.96|During the first quarter of 2022, Amazon’s current ratio is less than 1, which means the company may have difficulty to pay its current liabilities|
|2) Quick ratio|0.71|The quick ratio is less than 1. It means Amazon’s ability to pay its current liabilities in a short time is relatively low. |
|3) Inventory Turnover|1.9|During the first quarter of 2022, Amazon’s average total inventory was sold and replaced 1.9 times. The inventory turnover is lower than its previous counterparts|
|4) Debt to Equity Ratio|2.07|Amazon’s liabilities twice its equity. It means creditors own two-thirds of its assets. This may not be preferable to investors.|
|5) ROA|5.44%|For the past 12 months, Amazon’s profitability has been good. |
|6) Earnings per Share|$-0.38(Quarterly EPS)|The EPS is negative. It means Amazon had a net loss during the first quarter of 2022.|
|7) Earnings Yield| 1.70%(2022/7/25)|For the past 12 months, Amazon had a net income and the earnings per share weighted 1.7% of its latest market price per share.|
|8) Payout Ratio|0|Amazon didn’t pay dividends to its shareholders. |

                             HORIZONTAL ANALYSIS
               For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
                           Amount (in million)        increase/(decrease)
                            2021      2020            change      percentage
Sales revenue              469,822   386,064          83,758         21.7%
Operating income           24,879    22,899           1,980           8.6%

Comment: From 2020 to 2021, Amazon’s sales revenue increased by 21.7% while its operating
income increased by 8.6%. This indicates that the company’s operating expenses had increased 
by a greater percentage than its sales revenue. Looking further into the statement of 
operations, Amazon spent nearly 50% more money on marketing and fulfillment in 2021 than 
2020. Unlike in 2020, the pandemic effect which promotes online shopping was weaker in 2021. 
This was likely to have caused the increase in Amazon’s marketing expenses and fulfillment 
costs.

                             2021       2020           change       percentage
Total assets                420,549    321,195         99,354          30.9%
Total stockholder’s equity  138,245    93,404          44,841            48%

Comment: From 2020 to 2021, Amazon’s total assets increased by 30.9% and total stockholder’s
 equity increased by 48%. This indicates that Amazon might have sold additional shares of 
 stock. As Amazon’s sales significantly increased after the pandemic, people are more likely 
 to buy its stock.

Net income                              33,364                    7.1%

Comment: Amazon’s operating income in 2021 weighted 5.3% of its sales revenue and net 
income weighted 7.1% of sales revenue. The positive percentages suggest Amazon’s good 
profitability.

                                    2021 (in million)       Percentage (rounded)
Total assets                            420,549                    100%
Total liabilities                       282,304                   67.1%
Retained earnings                        85,915                   20.4%

Comment: Amazon’s total liabilities in 2021 weighted 67.1% of total assets. This debt ratio 
is relatively high. This may indicate that it is difficult for Amazon to borrow money. The 
retained earnings in 2021 weighted 20.4% of total assets. It means 20.4% of Amazon’s assets 
was supported by the accumulated earnings from the previous year.
