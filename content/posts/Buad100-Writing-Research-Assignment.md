<span style = "font-family: Times New Roman;font-size:1.2em; ">The value of a business is typically indicated by its assets—property, plants, equipment, inventory and even human resources (Lumen Learning et al). However, information is arguably the most essential component for businesses to remain competitive. It is generally accepted that the explosion of technology has led the world into the Information Age. The utilization of information not only means that businesses should stay in control of their data, but also means they should keep up to date with the development of technology. To gain the most efficient and effective access to information, business owners should invest in their equipment of latest technology. By using information, companies will be able to achieve revenue increases through improving their business processes, enhancing their marketing efforts, and optimizing their customer experiences.

<span style = "font-family: Times New Roman;font-size:1.2em; ">Businesses use information to improve business processes. Many businesses employ enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to continuously improve their operation. “The ERP systems track business resources—cash, raw materials, production capacity—and the status of business commitments: orders, purchase orders, and payroll” (Lumen Learning et al). With all the information easily accessed, businesses are able to find opportunities to improve or enhance those processes. For example, a sales report will help a company to improve its unprofitable business segments and expand profitable ones. As an online retailer, Amazon has an extraordinary platform to collect their purchase information. Occasionally,  Amazon tracks items that sell well from third-party partners, it may decide to sell the same item through its own brand at a lower cost. By doing so, “Amazon gains the benefit of building awareness for consumer demand without the initial investment in the product” (Bixby, Clive). 

<span style = "font-family: Times New Roman;font-size:1.2em; ">Businesses also use information to enhance marketing efforts. Helping companies target their customers is probably the most important function of information. The use of data mining techniques and tools allows businesses to understand and predict consumer behavior by gathering information about existing and potential customers and identifying patterns and knowledge from large datasets (Lumen Learning et al). One of Amazon's most effective marketing strategies is the highly personalized product recommendations that it sends to customers based upon their purchases, past orders, location, age, gender, and on-site browsing (Miller, Grace). Besides, Amazon’s addition of a simple feature allowing customers to vote whether they think each review is helpful also led to its revenue rise to $2.7 billion each year (Miller, Grace). Compared to the information posted by manufactures, the reviews generated and voted by customers seem to be much more trustworthy to the majority of Amazon customers.

<span style = "font-family: Times New Roman;font-size:1.2em; ">Businesses use information to optimize customer experience. There is no doubt that the most important factor of success for a business is to what extent it satisfies its customers’ demands. The demands of customers happen both before and after purchases. With the application of information and relevant technology like websites and mobile apps, businesses can optimize both pre-sales and post-sales services in order to enhance customer experience. According to Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky, one of Amazon’s strategies of ensuring customer experience is value proposition. He said, “We want our customers to be able to see new brands and have an easier time discovering products that they’re looking for.” Amazon did this through its customized advertising business, which also led to its revenue increasing by 60% from 2017 to 2018 (Vizard, Sarah). Throughout the process, Amazon developed an intuitive customer service platform and provided 24/7 assistance via phone, email and live chat, ensuring they were responsive and efficient in their response to customers' needs.

<span style = "font-family: Times New Roman;font-size:1.2em; ">Information is essential for business nowadays. The use of business data basically affects the creation of a product or service. To achieve revenue increase, the strategies of business can be concluded as improving the quality of product or service, expanding sales or market, and satisfying demands of customers (Lumen Learning et al). With proper and creative use of information, all these goals can be better achieved, thus increasing the revenue and improving the competence of a company.
