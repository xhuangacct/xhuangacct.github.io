**General purpose**: To inform my audience

**Specific purpose**: To explain what is confirmation bias and how to avoid it


<center>INTRODUCTION</center>

Imagine you are a married man and your wife believes you are cheating on her. When you try to explain, she says you are just trying to conceal. When you try to make her feel better, she says you do all those things because you feel guilty. Why does this happen? Because of confirmation bias.

Or Imagine you are a woman working in a company. When your employer thinks women are incompetent to men, if you try to do things better than your male colleges do, he thinks you lack self-confidence; if you do things worse than they do, he thinks you are truly incompetent; if you do things just as good as they do, he thinks you lack creativity. Why? Also because of confirmation bias.

So, **what is confirmation bias, and what can we do to avoid it**?


<center>BODY</center>


Just like in the situations I mentioned, sometimes you feel it’s impossible to change other people’s mind. It is because that person already has an opinion about you and he believes in this opinion stubbornly. This cognitive bias makes him only look for, interpret, or recall information that supports this opinion but ignore or distort other information that invalidates this opinion. This phenomenon was named “confirmation bias” by an English psychologist, Peter Wason. In 1960, Peter Wason conducted his famous research, the 2-4-6 task and pointed out that people usually hold their personal assumptions or hypothesis towards things which can make them really illogical and irrational (Acks, 2019). 

In fact, confirmation bias can happen to anybody. Believe or not, each of us has similar or different confirmation biases. Some people think left-handed people are more creative than right-handed people. Others believe in astrology predictions. Sometimes you simply don’t believe you can accomplish anything, and that can be a confirmation bias. All these happen out of our cultures, our values, and our experiences. I once read a story. A priest and an atheist sit in a bar in Alaska. The atheist says last month when he was outside he was caught in a blizzard alone. He was so scared and prayed to God for help. The priest says then you must believe in God now since you are still alive. The atheist says no God didn’t show up, a couple of Eskimos saved me (Sprouts, 2019). 

Studies have found that people who see things in oversimplified dichotomization, judge things instead of analyzing them, or rush into a quick conclusion with a single evidence tend to have more confirmation biases (Bar-Tal et al, 2019). Therefore, we can consciously avoid confirmation bias by thinking systematically and analytically and trying to make conclusions with caution. Moreover, we can practice through three specific ways.

**First, test your hypothesis**. Tell yourself, “I know what I believe but I could be wrong” and intentionally look for evidence to prove your initial hypothesis wrong. By doing so, you will find to what extent or from which perspective your opinion does make sense and thus avoid oversimplifying things. 

**Second, use conscious processing**. When you read an article, try to mindfully pay attention to what you agree or disagree with,  think about what information in that article makes you feel your opinion is reinforced or challenged. Doing so can increase the accuracy of your interpretation.

**Third, seek all relevant evidence**. If a conclusion is based on only one or two pieces of information, it’s probably biased. Seek more relevant evidence, not only that confirms your assumption, but also that opposes it. You can avoid making hasty and misleading judgments by doing so.

<center>CONCLUSION</center>

Today, we have discussed what is confirmation bias—looking for, interpreting, or recalling information that supports your pre-existing beliefs. We also learned three ways to practice avoiding confirmation bias—testing your hypothesis, using conscious processing, and seeking all relevant evidence. 

Confirmation bias is a natural tendency of our brain to process information and deal with uncertainty. It can contribute to bad relationships, discriminations, misunderstandings, and poor choices. Even though it is not assured, if we remind ourselves of the possibility that we might have confirmation biases, we are more likely to keep our mind open and think critically, and reduce our mistakes caused by confirmation bias. 

That’s all. Thank you for your attention. Any questions?
