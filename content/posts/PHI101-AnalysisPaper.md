# Comparison of Aristotle's and Confucius' Doctrines of the Mean



#### Introduction


Aristotle (384 BC - 322 BC) and Confucius (551 BC - 479 BC) were both great philosophers of their eras. Coincidentally, the two philosophers developed their doctrines of the Mean in similar or different settings. Aristotle’s virtuous Mean is introduced in his book Nicomachean Ethics(Book II),while Confucius's doctrine of the Mean is introduced in an ancient Chinese book called The doctrine of the mean, written by Zisi, who was Confucius’s grandson. This paper is going to analyse some of the similarities and differences between Aristotle's and Confucious’ doctrines of the Mean.


#### The similarities of the two doctrines of the Mean

1) Both doctrines are mentioned as “hard”, formed through practising, and consist of both knowing and doing. In his work Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle said, “It is harder to fight with pleasure than with anger, to use Heraclitus’ phrase, but both art and virtue are always concerned with what is harder; for even the good is better when it is harder.”[^1] Confucius also said, “The Mean in action is the ultimate! Few among the people can long cleave to it.”[^2]

    Aristotle said, “Moral virtue comes about as a result of habit.” He mentioned many times that people “learn by doing”, and also “on one would have a prospect of becoming good” without doing good acts. He also said that people who wished to become good simply through becoming philosophers were wrong, in that way they would not be made well in either body or soul[^3]. Confucius concisely put that the Dao would not be put into practice because the wise go beyond it and the ignorant do not reach it.

2) Both are regulated with respect to the right times, reference to objects, people, motive and way. Aristotle said, “ Both fear and confidence and appetite and anger and pity and in general pleasure and pain may be felt both too much and too little, and in both cases not well; but to feel them at the right times, with reference to the right objects, towards the right people, with the right motive, and in the right way, is what is both intermediate and best, and this is characteristic of virtue. Similarly with regard to actions also there is excess, defect, and the intermediate.” It is clear that both the sensing of emotion and acting accordingly can be judged as virtuous or vicious. Aristotle also said, “virtue is concerned with passions and actions, in which excess is a form of failure, and so is defect, while the intermediate is praised and is a form of success.”

    In the book The Doctrine of the Mean, the corresponding parts of the virtue can be found. Confucius said, “When joy, anger, sorrow and pleasure have not yet arisen, it is called the Mean (centeredness, equilibrium). When they arise to their appropriate levels, it is called ‘harmony’”[^4]. In another paragraph, Confucious said, “The noble man actualizes the Mean because he is always with it.” This sentence is also translated as “the Mean of junzi is such that he is always exact in his timeliness”[^5]. According to the other dialogues of Confucius, the action of the Mean is not simple but may vary from time to time. A man who is always with the Mean doesn’t mean that he does the same thing at any time but that he reacts to different circumstances according to the same principle. Thus that he will act the Mean at any time means that he will do the right things at the right time. When describing how to act the Mean toward the right people, Confucius said, “To serve my father with that which I seek from my son…To serve my ruler with that seek from my subordinates…To serve my elders with that which I seek from my juniors…To first practice towards my friends what I seek from them”, and he also illustrated it as “gaining the trust of your superiors”, “being faithful to your friends”, and “being obedient to your parents (also translated as relatives)”[^6]. The Mean can be formed by perfecting one’s genuineness based on being clear about the good. Confucius said, “One who is perfectly genuine hits the mark without effort, succeeds without forethought. To keep to the centre of the Dao at perfect ease is to be a sage.”[^7] Therefore a perfectly genuine person is a person who perfectly masters the Mean, namely a sage. Also Confucius mentioned Aristotle’s “the reference of the right objects”, “One who makes things perfectly genuine is one who chooses the good and invariably grasps it tight.”It is the right kind of good that ensures the things to be made perfectly genuine. In a word, a man with Mean is a man who is both perfectly genuine himself and capable of making things perfectly genuine.

#### The differences between the two doctrines of the Mean

1) The source and measurement of virtue: relatively us VS ordained by Heaven. Aristotle’s Virtuous Mean is determined by rational principles that are developed by the virtuous people and relative to the subjects while the Confucian Mean is ordained by Heaven and is a kind of imitation of human nature. Aristotle said, “Thus a master of any art avoids excess and defect, but seeks the intermediate and chooses this- the intermediate not in the object but relatively to us.” Confucian Mean was described, “That which is ordained by Tian is called our nature; to lead by our nature is called the Dao; to cultivate the Dao is called the teaching.” 

2) Aristotle’s Virtue has the characteristics of being praised and being successful while Confucian Dao will be sticked to by the noble person even when he is unknown. 

3) Aristotle’s Mean sometimes may not be taken as virtue while Confucian Mean is the ultimate or pinnacle of virtue. According to Aristotle, some vices are the characters which are definitely bad, even when they are divided into deficit, mediate, and excess, the mean cannot be taken as virtue. Confucius didn’t illustrate such respects of the Mean, he said, “the mean in action is where virtue reaches its pinnacle.”

4) Aristotle’s description of the Mean is detailed and precise, while Confucius’s description of his Mean is abstract and vague.

5) To apply Aristotle’s Mean, a person must be rigorous, critical and realistic , while to apply Confucius’ Mean, a person should be a high self-monitor with high motivation.
