<center>INTRODUCTION</center>

Good morning, Professor Boas, good morning, class. My name is Xianglin Huang. I’m here to persuade you to take a break. 

Last week, I cut my thumb hard while I was in the kitchen. I was literally shocked because normally I don’t do that and it happened when I actually focused my eyesight on my fingers. I saw it happen. What went wrong with me? After a brief research on the internet, I realized I was tired and under pressure, and I felt lucky that I wasn’t seriously injured.

Do you know people die of tiredness? According to statistics, the annual incidence of sudden death in Western European and American countries is 0.1–0.2%. Over 95% of young people who suddenly died have died of fatigue-related fatal diseases (Zhu, et al, 2019). Namely, they were killed by tiredness. 

Do you know pressure can also cause death? People are more likely to smoke, drink too much alcohol, or eat unhealthy food, or experience anxiety, depression, and isolation from friends and family when they are stressed. 
Long term stress increases the risk of having hypertension. According to the CDC website, hypertension-related heart disease or stroke are leading causes of death in the United States. In 2020, more than 670,000 deaths in the United States had hypertension as a primary or contributing cause.

Here, I highly recommend you, if either of these symptoms happens to you or whenever you think you need to, please take a break. You will never regret doing so because scientists have found that taking a 20-minute-break three times a week will reduce your tiredness and pressure, enhance your mental health, and strengthen your motivation and performance.

**First and foremost, taking a break helps us reduce our tiredness and pressure.** Studies have found that taking breaks is important in recovering from stress. It can help people restore energy and mental resources and decrease the development of fatigue, sleep disorders and cardiovascular diseases. 

**Second, taking a break helps enhance our mental health.** Regular short breaks have been found to improve mood, stress management and overall index dimensions of emotional intelligence of primary school students. During the coronavirus pandemic, many people experienced anxiety because of the tremendous change of their lifestyles and workstyles, especially nurses. High rates of fatigue and burnout were found in nursing staff (Sikaras, 2022), which caused concern of researchers. In 2021, Amy Rettig, a mental health APRN (namely, Advanced practice registered nurses ) of Ohio State University Wexner medical center, did her take-a-break research on oncology clinic nurses. The result showed that taking a break positively lifted their moods, improved their enjoyment, and helped them feel comfortable (Rettig, 2021).

**Third, taking a break helps strengthen our motivation and performance.** A latest study conducted by Psychologists from Missouri State University showed that taking a break in the middle of a lecture actually increased motivation and energy in college students. Another study found that active breaks improved the working memory, reaction time, and prohibitory control of primary school students.

<center>CONCLUSION</center>

In conclusion, whenever you feel tired or stressed about your class or job, take a break; when you feel overwhelmed by bad moods or negative thoughts, take a break; when you feel a lack of motivation or concentration, take a break. Especially, try to take a break from things that appear to be enjoyable but actually may cause long-term harm to you, for example, social media, over eating, or your phone. You will find yourself more energetic, focused, peaceful and calm if you regularly take 20-minute short breaks. Besides, how many of you have been ignoring your friends and family by focusing on your phone? How many times have you blown up a project because you keep procrastinating or avoid starting it? It’s time to take a break, restore the best version of yourself, and improve your relationship with people, and maintain your best efforts in meaningful jobs.
