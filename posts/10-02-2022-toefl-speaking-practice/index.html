I admire her because of her exceptional credibility, sincerity, and passion.<br></li></ul></li><li><p>Question 3:</p><ul><li>In my opinion, the university should spend the money on housing improvements. The reason for this is that I believe poor housing conditions could pose a safety hazard for students and damage the university&rsquo;s reputation.<br></li></ul></li><li><p>question 4:</p><ul><li>The passage states that the problem is the poisonous cane toad. The toad is threatening many of the spiecies in Australia.<br></li></ul></li><li><p>Question 5:</p><ul><li>The problem is that A cannot finish his work on time. In my view, the better solution is to ask his boss for an extension. This is because I believe that asking for a reasonable extension would better demonstrate his responsibility and ensure his accomplishment of his work than simply asking his boss to reassign it to someone else.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Summary for the introduction part</strong>:</p><ol><li>Understand the question type:<ul><li>present your opinion</li><li>describe something</li><li>explain facts</li><li>summarize someone else&rsquo;s position</li></ul></li><li>state your topic related to the purpose.</li><li>Give your reasons concisely.</li></ol><p>Body paragraph practice:</p><p>Question 1:</p><p>Agree or not? It is better for students to gain real-world experience than to spend their time in a classroom.</p><ul><li>I don&rsquo;t think real-world experience is better than time spent in a classroom. I disagree with this argument because I think time spent in a classroom usually tends to be more effecient and productive.</li><li>First, I believe learning is a process that requires a student to think and to reflect but not just to imitate the techniques. In this case, a classroom is a essential place to learn. In a classroom, a student can learn through both listening to the lecture, reading the materials related to certain topics, and thinking a certain problem. Students are able to go deeper in classroom than in a real-world environment.</li><li>Second, I believe an important outcome of learning is better understanding of the knowledge and valuable novel ideas. A classroom is better than the real-world environment because it provide less distractions and more source of thinking and communicating. It nurtures better focus on knowledge and deeper understanding of facts, which I think are essential to generate the learning outcomes.</li><li>Third, some students may plan on furthering their education before they start to work. In that case, spending more time in classroom will undoubtedly essential for them to stretch their thinking and writing abilities.</li><li>As a result, I don&rsquo;t agree with the argument that it is better for students to gain real-world experience than to spend time in a classroom.</li></ul><p>Sample Response:</p><ul><li>Real-world experience is usually better than time spent in a classroom. I believe this because experience is the best teacher.</li><li>one example of a way in which real-world experience is valuable is that students studying auto mechanics cannot just read about an engine. Instead, they have to practice taking that engine apart piece by piece and then put it back together. Only then will students understand the concept.</li><li>A second example of a way in which real-world experience is valuable can be applied to learning a foreign language. If students in a classroom never have a chance to practice the language, they may forget the skills they were taught. In this instance, it would also be helpful to practice their skills in a real-world environment.</li></ul><p>Question 2:</p><p>positive role model.</p><ul><li>An influencial individual whom I think is a positive model is Jane Goodall. One reason I feel that she is a positive role model is because she sticks to her interest in studying chimpanzees and never give up. Jane Goodall devotes over 60 years of her life her research on chimpanzees. She started her research at 27 and is now 88 years old. Her lifelong career is exceptionally inspiring. Another reason I think Jane Goodall is a positive role model is because she demonstrates a deep sympathy and love for animals. Though she didn&rsquo;t strive too much to become famous, she did become very famous for her legendary life experience, founding an organization to encourage children to protect animals,and giving speeches to call for attention to the living conditions of chimpanzees. It is very positive for a person to try to help another species on earth.</li></ul><p>Question 3:</p><ul><li>I would support mandatory classes for freshman instead of allowing the students to choose whatever classes they want.</li><li>First, this will ensure a certain quality of education. With standardized classes, universities can make sure that all of their students are familiar with important intellectual works. That way, all students will have a basic educational level.</li><li>Moreover, required classes will serve to extent the deadline of students to decide which specific areas they are interested in. Freshmen can sometimes have difficulty choosing their favorite classes, so they can easily make poor choices. Required classes will allow them to make choice after they gain a basic knowledge from the first year study.</li></ul><p>Question 4:The most important education occurs not during adulthood but during childhood.</p><ul><li>I disagree with the statement.</li><li>One reason is that I believe the most important education may happen in adulthood because I think adults are capale to learn and change. For many people who don&rsquo;t have a chance to receive good education when they were young, they still get chance to learn the most important lessons in their adulthood. Though the prabability is low, it is possible for grown-ups to experience a mentally &ldquo;reborn&rdquo; through education and thus change their whole lives.</li><li>Another reason is I think the most education may occur at any period of time during the whole life of a person. Some people may be inspired by their childhood education to discover their life dreams and to make their life choices. Other people may take a long time wandering about until they finally learn what they are really into from their adulthood education. I believe there is no general pattern of when the most important education will happen.</li><li>Therefore, I don&rsquo;t agree with the statement that the most important education occurs not during adulthood but during childhood.</li></ul><p>Question 5: Summerize the points in the professor&rsquo;s lecture, and explain how the points cast doubt on the reading.</p><ul><li>In the lecture, the professor states three main points.</li><li>First, it is a misblief that organisms act out of concern for the &ldquo;greater good&rdquo; of the species.</li><li>Second, people misinterpreted actions as being for the good of the species.</li><li>Third, actions are not for the good of the species, but for selfish reasons.</li><li>To support his points, the professor illustrated the example of crickets traveling in group to migrate. The professor points out that it is an easy assumption that crickets believed in strength in numbers, which was shown not the case by a researcher. With reference to other scientific research, the professor also thinks that the reason why cricket choose to migrate together is to avoid being eaten but not to help their fellow crickets.</li><li>These main points and analysis of the exampel directly cast doubt on the reading, which interpret the behavior as the crickets realize the safety in numbers and put aside their selfish instinct for the good of all members.</li></ul></div></article><div id=footer-post-container><div id=footer-post><div id=nav-footer style=display:none><ul><li><a href=/>Home</a></li><li><a href=/posts>Writings</a></li><li><a href=/tags>Tags</a></li><li><a href=/about>About</a></li><li><a href=/cv>CV</a></li></ul></div><div id=toc-footer style=display:none><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></div><div id=share-footer style=display:none><ul><li><a class=icon href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fxhuangacct.github.io%2fposts%2f10-02-2022-toefl-speaking-practice%2f" aria-label=Facebook><i class="fab fa-facebook fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fxhuangacct.github.io%2fposts%2f10-02-2022-toefl-speaking-practice%2f&text=TOEFL%20Speaking%20Ideas" aria-label=Twitter><i class="fab fa-twitter fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3a%2f%2fxhuangacct.github.io%2fposts%2f10-02-2022-toefl-speaking-practice%2f&title=TOEFL%20Speaking%20Ideas" aria-label=Linkedin><i class="fab fa-linkedin fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?url=https%3a%2f%2fxhuangacct.github.io%2fposts%2f10-02-2022-toefl-speaking-practice%2f&is_video=false&description=TOEFL%20Speaking%20Ideas" aria-label=Pinterest><i class="fab fa-pinterest fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="mailto:?subject=TOEFL%20Speaking%20Ideas&body=Check out this article: https%3a%2f%2fxhuangacct.github.io%2fposts%2f10-02-2022-toefl-speaking-practice%2f" aria-label=Email><i class="fas fa-envelope fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="https://getpocket.com/save?url=https%3a%2f%2fxhuangacct.github.io%2fposts%2f10-02-2022-toefl-speaking-practice%2f&title=TOEFL%20Speaking%20Ideas" aria-label=Pocket><i class="fab fa-get-pocket fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https%3a%2f%2fxhuangacct.github.io%2fposts%2f10-02-2022-toefl-speaking-practice%2f&title=TOEFL%20Speaking%20Ideas" aria-label=reddit><i class="fab fa-reddit fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="http://www.tumblr.com/share/link?url=https%3a%2f%2fxhuangacct.github.io%2fposts%2f10-02-2022-toefl-speaking-practice%2f&name=TOEFL%20Speaking%20Ideas&description=Introduction%20practice%3a%0aQuestion%201%3a%0aIf%20I%20could%20have%20any%20job%2c%20I%20would%20choose%20to%20be%20a%20writer.%20This%20is%20because%20I%20enjoy%20telling%20stories%20and%20experiencing%20things%20deeply%20and%20making%20people%20feel%20more%20alive.%0aIf%20I%20could%20have%20any%20job%2c%20I%20would%20choose%20to%20be%20an%20icecream%20truck%20driver.%20I%20think%20this%20because%20it%20is%20a%20lifelong%20dream%20of%20me%20and%20I%20enjoy%20seeing%20others%26rsquo%3b%20happy%20when%20they%20get%20icecreams.%20Question%202%3a" aria-label=Tumblr><i class="fab fa-tumblr fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="https://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https%3a%2f%2fxhuangacct.github.io%2fposts%2f10-02-2022-toefl-speaking-practice%2f&t=TOEFL%20Speaking%20Ideas" aria-label="Hacker News"><i class="fab fa-hacker-news fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li></ul></div><div id=actions-footer><a id=menu-toggle class=icon href=# onclick='return $("#nav-footer").toggle(),!1' aria-label=Menu><i class="fas fa-bars fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i> Menu</a>
