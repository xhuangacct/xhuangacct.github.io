(6 pts)</dt><dd>According to Joe Tenebruso (2021), Amazon’s stock price jumped in October 2021 after its retail sales unexpectedly climbed in September 2021. At that point, analysts predicted that Amazon would boost its profits to as much as 15% (Tenebruso, 2021). PayPal Holdings announced in November 2021 that Venmo users can start using the Venmo app to purchase Amazon products starting next year (Bowman, 2021), further boosting the stock price. These are the most important reasons that Amazon’s stock price reached its peak in the past year.
Amazon stock plunged in the second quarter of 2022 since Amazon reported a net loss of $3.8 billion for the first quarter of 2022 (Iyengar, 2022). Due to the pandemic, war in Ukraine, and ongoing inflation, Amazon was under supply chain pressures and had higher costs than the previous year. Stock prices had dropped continuously during April and May 2022, contributing most to its lowest price in the past year.</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>Write about any recent activity/event affecting the company in your own words. Your write up must be at least 200 words. (6 points)</dt><dd>On July 12 and 13, 2022, Amazon was estimated to have generated 11.9 billion dollars in revenue from its Prime Day deal event (Berthiaume, 2022), which was an 8.5% increase over last year. According to Amazon (“Prime Day 2022”), its Prime member customers bought more than 300 million items worldwide during the two days. Sales revenue on Prime Day reached its peak in Amazon&rsquo;s history in 2022 and was supposed to signal a pick-up trend of sales revenue on regular days as well. Amazon’s stock price went up after the first day of Prime Day. It rose more than 20% since July 12 to its current level by the end of July. This is a good sign for Amazon’s stockholders. The impact of Amazon&rsquo;s Prime Day sales on total sales growth will be seen in the third quarter of 2022. Investors will be optimistic about Amazon&rsquo;s profitability if the total growth exceeds its expected value, and if that is the case, the stock price is likely to rise in October. However, before the financial report of the third quarter is released, it’s hard to say which direction the stock price will go. It is unlikely that Prime Day 2022&rsquo;s record-breaking sales will boost sales on regular days, nor will it influence the stock price long term.</dd></dl></li><li><p>Compute any 8 financial statement ratios.

(Comment: From 2020 to 2021, Amazon’s sales revenue increased by 21.7% while its operating income increased by 8.6%. This indicates that the company’s operating expenses had increased by a greater percentage than its sales revenue. Looking further into the statement of operations, Amazon spent nearly 50% more money on marketing and fulfillment in 2021 than 2020. Unlike in 2020, the pandemic effect which promotes online shopping was weaker in 2021. This was likely to have caused the increase in Amazon’s marketing expenses and fulfillment costs.)</p><p>2021
