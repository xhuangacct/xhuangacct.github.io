The author states that the role of accountants today will be played by robots in the future. This is driven by three factors: 1)the power of advanced technology. Technology overpowers humans in specific aspects. For example, AI reads and processes tax faster and cheaper than a professional accountant. The application of technology will improve efficiency as well as reduce costs for firms. 2) money. Large amounts of money have flowed into the accounting profession (Padar, 2022). With the intention of gaining a desirable return from the investment of money, accounting firms are going to apply technological tools such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to acquire competitive advantages. 3) CPAs. The change is driven by both satisfaction and anxiety of accounting professionals. With deeper application of technology to the accounting profession, an accountant could easily get his job done. However, accounting professionals have to worry about themselves being replaced by machines. Embracing new technologies will be a good choice for them to remain valuable in the field. At least they will know how to properly handle technological tools better than other people. Besides, knowing better of how machines work as accountants will help them to redefine their own roles and values (Padar, 2022).</p><h4 id=commentsfeedback>Comments/Feedback</h4><p>The automation of accounting has become a concerning issue for the accounting world. The accounting world has been very steady for many years. But now it is more and more struck by advanced technology. Softwares and applications have the capacity to do many parts of accounting. The IRS uses computers to deal with large amounts of tax return cases and audits. Accounting jobs will become increasingly automated, leaving fewer job opportunities for accounting professionals, especially those of lower skill levels. I would say this is both good and bad news. It is a bad news for those who plan to enter the accounting profession, but it is a good news that productivity of the industry will be improved.</p><h2 id=using-data-visualization-to-help-uncover-fraud>Using Data Visualization To Help Uncover Fraud</h2><h3 id=summary-1>Summary</h3><p>This article explains that the peculiar pattern detected in data visualization of a company’s internal financial data can signal accounting misconduct. With the internal financial information of Wirecard, a large German financial service company which was reported to have committed an accounting problem, the author conducted his research with data visualization tools and found some intriguing patterns and trends among the data. Such unusual trends and patterns include: 1) the consolidated gross margin ratio much higher than competitors; 2) the average gross margin of subsidiaries higher than the consolidated group; 3) wirecard relied on three opaque partners for almost all its profit; 4) the commission rate for customers fluctuate drastically; 5) significantly higher margin for one particular customer (high outlier); 6) lower margin for one customers demonstrating opposite trend to other customers while comparing to competitors (lower outlier); 7) typical different trends (steady or fluctuate) for different customers; 8) similar patterns in transaction counts for four particular customers over the year. All these trends and patterns can be clearly shown through graphs and plots, signaling further investigations. The author suggests that data visualization will be a good tool to assist auditors planning and performing audits (Bakarich, 2022).</p><h4 id=commentfeedback>Comment/Feedback</h4><p>The occurrence of accounting misconduct is due to pressure, opportunity, and rationalization. It is good news that data visualization may empower the process of audit by signaling fraud. Such powerful tools are likely to lessen the opportunity of fraud occurring. However, there is no strong evidence in this article to show that all the patterns and trends have a direct relationship with the activity of fraud. Further studies and proof of the accuracy of data visualization should be conducted.</p><h2 id=department-of-labor-position-on-cryptocurrency-investment-in-401k-plans>Department of Labor Position on Cryptocurrency Investment in 401(k) Plans</h2><h4 id=summary-2>Summary</h4><p>This article&rsquo;s main claim is that the Department of Labor has issued extremely strict regulations on cryptocurrency investment initiations, which is likely to discourage 401(k) plan fiduciaries from including cryptocurrency to their investment menu. Such regulatory policy requires employers and plan fiduciaries to: 1) ask appropriate questions; 2) conduct due diligence; 3) monitor fund performance; 4) review peer group analysis; 5) take action necessary to protect plan participants to satisfy their duties of prudence and loyalty (Geller, 2022). By issuing such regulatory policy, the Department of Labor demonstrates its determination to protect cryptocurrency investment participants. Failing to recharge the responsibilities listed above will probably lead to regulatory investigations and class action lawsuits against employers and plan fiduciaries. The article warns employers of the imprudence of cryptocurrency investments and emphasizes that “401(k) plan fiduciaries must take their duties of responsible fund selection and responsible stewardship seriously” (Geller, 2022).</p><h4 id=commentfeedback-1>Comment/Feedback</h4><p>Cryptocurrency has become a hot topic in the last few years. However, the frenzy of cryptocurrency is hardly rational. Investors will be over-optimistic when markets increase. Therefore, it is crucial for the DOL to hold a technology-neutral or conservative attitude towards the development of the cryptocurrency market.The regulatory policies are a big challenge to the cryptocurrency markets. However, cryptocurrency has demonstrated its unique characteristics and capacity of promoting a boost of the economy in recent years. It is very likely that the markets are going to mature. This field is worth paying attention to.</p><h2 id=what-every-cpa-should-know-about-disrupted-supply-chains>What every CPA should know about disrupted supply chains</h2><h4 id=summary-3>Summary</h4><p>The article states that every finance leader should learn about supply chain in order to provide valuable financial advice because the disrupted supply chains since the pandemic has led to tremendous business changes. Supply chain used to be hyper-efficient, focusing on minimizing cost, increasing speed, and minimizing inventory before the pandemic. By now, companies rely on a more complex network of supplies in order to ensure redundancies, which is essential to navigate hard times. This will tremendously change the accounting situation, such as more capital investments, more assets, more lending to support extra capital, and more complex financing. Accountants are supposed to learn about the supply chain in order to properly reflect the relevant activities. The article suggests that finance professionals should: 1) network, try to connect with people from different disciplines; 2) connect with specialist advisers, build a positive connection with advisers to make sure sources of advice; 3) learn from other parts of the business, try to broaden knowledge and experience; 4) track news, always catch up on the latest news (Kenney, 2022).</p><h4 id=commentfeedback-2>Comment/Feedback</h4><p>The essential role of supply chain in businesses has been amplified during the pandemic. Many American companies relied on Chinese factories for their inventory and supplies. However, China has been implementing strict shipping restrictions since the Covid-19 pandemic. The supply chains was disrupted by tariffs as well as lockdown. Large international companies have to change their strategies of supply chain. This may create more opportunities for local vendors and suppliers. Relatively, the accounting process of companies is facing more complexities. Along with being challenged by technology, management accounting professionals have to deal with more challenges from the new situations. However, this can be a new opportunity for accounting professionals. Accountants will be more valuable in their profession if they possess cross-disciplinary knowledge.</p><h2 id=5-steps-to-managing-client-expectations>5 steps to managing client expectations</h2><h4 id=summary-4>Summary</h4><p>This article emphasizes that accounting firms should live up to clients’ expectations of receiving “responsive, professional attention and actionable advice&rsquo;&rsquo; through establishing those expectations in Five steps, which will demonstrate a positive first impression and build strong and enduring client relationships (Dennis, 2022). The five steps are: 1) Lay the groundwork early, which means to explain right before it starts; 2) Be transparent about fees, let clients know how much they need to pay and why; 3) Keep the lines of communication open, make clients feel they are important and have the access to communicate with a CPA; 4) Emphasize key deadlines, ensure the clients know exactly when and how they need to cooperate; 5)Let clients know what&rsquo;s coming, always tell the clients what is going to happen to avoid any surprise (Dennis, 2022).</p><h4 id=commentfeedback-3>Comment/Feedback</h4><p>This article brings about key facts. A positive first impression and strong and enduring relationships are essential for any kind of business that involves humans, including accounting business. Accounting services require both expert knowledge and the ability to respond to the client&rsquo;s needs. It is very important to first treat clients as people, respecting their emotional needs. Generally speaking, emotional need is one of the basic needs of humans that can never be denied. Many businesses are built on the basis of emotional connection, such as trust. Through managing client expectations, an accountant is able to make clients feel respected and taken care of, which can promote their trust. Besides, keeping the client informed about all the necessary information and the next steps is also crucial to eliminating misunderstandings and simplifying the process.</p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ul><li>Padar, J.
